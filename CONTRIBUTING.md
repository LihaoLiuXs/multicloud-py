# Contributing to MultiCloud Python SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide describes how to propose changes and what maintainers expect from contributions.

## Governance

MultiCloud Python SDK is a Salesforce-sponsored open source project. The goal is to grow its contributor and user community while maintaining a consistent, cloud-agnostic API. Salesforce employees hold repository administration rights and make final decisions about accepted contributions.

## Before You Start

Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/salesforce/multicloud-py/issues) before opening a new one. For significant features or API changes, open an issue first so the approach and cross-provider behavior can be discussed before implementation begins.

## Development Setup

The repository is a [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) workspace. Clone your fork and install the workspace dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-user>/multicloud-py.git
cd multicloud-py
uv sync --frozen
```

Run the unit tests and replay-mode conformance tests before submitting a pull request:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not conformance"
uv run pytest tests/ -m conformance --record-mode=none
uv run black --check packages tests
uv run isort --check-only packages tests
```

CI tests Python 3.10 through 3.14. The required `test` check succeeds only when
every runtime and the formatting/version checks pass. On Python 3.12, CI also
enforces **90% total SDK line coverage** across unit and replay tests:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m pytest --record-mode=none \
  --cov=packages --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=90
```

Coverage includes the SDK source under `packages/`, including unimported
namespace modules. Do not omit provider code or add exclusions to meet the
threshold. Codecov project and changed-line targets are also 90%; its upload is
best-effort and does not replace the local CI coverage gate. Maintainers must
confirm Codecov repository access and reporting before requiring its statuses.

Conformance tests validate consistent behavior across supported providers. Recording new cassettes requires credentials for the relevant cloud provider; never commit credentials or unsanitized recordings.

## Issues and Feature Requests

- Report reproducible bugs through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/salesforce/multicloud-py/issues/new).
- Describe the expected cloud-agnostic behavior and affected providers.
- Include a minimal reproduction when possible.
- Discuss provider-specific features before implementation. Public APIs should remain implementable consistently across supported providers.

## Pull Requests

1. Create a focused branch in your fork.
2. Keep commits atomic and use descriptive commit messages.
3. Add or update unit and conformance tests for behavior changes.
4. Update user-facing documentation when APIs or behavior change.
5. Run the validation commands above.
6. Open a pull request against `main` and link the relevant issue.
7. Sign the Salesforce Contributor License Agreement when prompted.

Keep pull requests focused and avoid unrelated formatting or refactoring changes. All changes require peer review before merge.

Use a conventional PR title such as `fix(blob): preserve metadata` or
`docs: clarify onboarding`. Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`,
`revert`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, and `chore`. A scope is optional;
add `!` for a breaking change. The title becomes the squash commit subject used
by Release Please. Existing dependency-update PRs may need a maintainer to
retitle them before merging.

The `main` ruleset requires one eligible review, resolved review threads, and
successful CI, documentation, security, and CLA checks. New changes dismiss old
approvals. Maintainers add `conventional-title` to the required checks after
the new workflow has produced a successful check on its implementing PR; do not
require a check that cannot run yet. Code-owner review is a separate policy and is not
enabled merely by adding a CODEOWNERS file. The title workflow uses the same
read-only `pull_request` execution model as CI; it has no publishing credentials
or write permissions.

Release PRs follow the same review and check requirements. GitHub may require a
maintainer to approve workflow runs created by automation. Validate the final
generated-version commit before approving and squash-merging; never bypass the
ruleset to work around missing checks. Publishing remains in the existing
release workflow; this change does not add extra PyPI approval prompts or alter
the package Trusted Publishers.
